**Sharkoon computer:**
**Computer description.** 

This pc is 40.7 cm long, 34.8 cm tall and 18.4 cm wide and it runs on windows 10 operation software. It is entirely custom made which its only purpose is being fiddle around, taking it apart as well putting it back together by students so they can learn how to build a basic computer as well writing a useless essay’s like how I am doing. The case is made of some kind metal (I’m guessing aluminum) except the front which seems and feels like it was 3D printed. This pc seem not suitable for gaming because it lacks any of recommended gaming component such as graphics card, liquid color and it looks like a computer which you use for work.
This computer has a lot of wires with different color in it which connect with all kinds of stuff like graphics card, CPU and something, I just don’t want to bother to analyze any of it (yes, I am quite lazy right now). Speaking of wires, I am intentionally writing nonsense about this computer so I can stretch the essay as much as possible up to 500 words quota because I am already out ideas of what I should write. Also Isn’t 500 words too much? It does not have a lot for something to write, it is just an average desktop computer
